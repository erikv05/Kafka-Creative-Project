Now, you must download the code. On the page for the repository on GitHub, hit the green 'Code' button on the top right. Then, press "Download ZIP" and uncompress this file into an easy-to-access place like your desktop.

Then, run the main.py script:

macOS:

1) Open terminal (command+space, search 'terminal')

2) Type: python3 <PATH>
-<PATH> is replaced with the path of the file

To find the path, just drag and drop the main.py file into terminal.

The command should look something like this: python3 ~/Users/...

Then, hit ENTER to run the script.

Windows:

1) Open command prompt (windows key, search 'command')

2) Drag and drop the 'main.py' file from the downloaded folder into command prompt and hit ENTER.

Mechanically, if there are two choices to act and you don't type a valid option, the first choice will usually be assumed. For instance, if I ask you to type YES/NO, and you type "maybe," the program will assume you typed yes. Make sure to avoid typos. Case is ignored.
